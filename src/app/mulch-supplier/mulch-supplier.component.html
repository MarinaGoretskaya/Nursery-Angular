    <p>Whether you are a professional landscaper, golf course groundskeeper or an enthusiastic home gardener,

    <h5>Finding a Mulch Supplier in Southern Ontario</h5>
    <p>If you’re a gardening professional in Southern Ontario and you’re looking
      for a mulch supplier that can keep you stocked in all types of coverings,
      topsoils, compost and other materials, you may need more than just on-time
      deliveries. In this area organic gardening methods are the norm, and you’ll
      need to form a partnership with garden supply who conforms to the recent laws
      concerning insecticides, chemical fertilizers and weed killers. All of the products
      you receive need to be sterilized and tested for moisture and fertility using completely organic methods.</p>
    <p>If you’re a homeowner in communities such as Oakvile, Etobicoke,
      Milton, Burlington and Mississauga, the same standards apply.
      While you may not be purchasing bulk quantities of mulch on a regular basis,
      you still need product that is consistent in texture and color. You also need
      a variety of mulches such as cocoa bean, BC red cedar and hemlock to match your
      particular gardening or landscaping project.</p>
    <p>Van Beek’s Garden Supply has been a mulch supplier in Southern Ontario
      since 1962 and offers expert advice so that homeowners and professionals
      can purchase the appropriate mulch for any job.</p>
